## Energy Imbalance of Estonian Prosumers

Energy Prosumers are indivisuals, Businesses or organizations that both consume and produce energy. This concept represents a shift from the traditional model where consumers simply purchase energy from utilities and rely on centralized power generation sources.
The energy imbalance problem indicates that there exists imbalance between production and consumption of energy. That is the generated electricity mismatches the demanding side(for example unexpected energy consumption behavior)
The goal of this project is to analyze energy consumption and production patterns of prosumers given the auxillary features like electricity, gas prices, installed solar panel capacity. This can be formulated as a Time series regression problem

Intensive Analysis was performed using Dash and Plotly
